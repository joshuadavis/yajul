--- How to use the YAJUL build tools ---

The YAJUL nightly build uses the following products:
* JDK 1.4 or higher - http://java.sun.com
* ANT (1.6.x) - http://ant.apache.org
* Clover (provided) - http://www.cenqua.com/clover/
* Forrest (0.7) - Http://forrest.apache.org

In order to run the full YAJUL build (the build.xml in this directory), install these products as follows:

1) Download and install ANT from http://ant.apache.org.   Make sure your shell or command prompt has JAVA_HOME and ANT_HOME defined.
2) Copy clover.jar from this directory into ANT_HOME/lib.
3) Download and install Forrest from http://forrest.apache.org.
