YAJUL - Yet Another Java Utility Library

To build Yajul, you will need:

* Maven 3
* The JBoss Maven Repository https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/repositories/  (for Arquillian, etc.)

To build all of the modules and add them to your local Maven repository, skipping the tests:
* mvn clean install -DskipTests

To do a 'full build', including all tests:
* mvn clean verify
