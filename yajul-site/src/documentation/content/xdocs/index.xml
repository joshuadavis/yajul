      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p><strong>YAJUL</strong> is a set of Java utility libraries for Java enterprise application development.
     The libraries are organize by the type of useage, allowing a lightweight implementation.
     The core library is required by all other libraries, and includes Log4J logging, IO utilities,
     XML DOM / SAX / XSLT utilities, and some multi-threading code.
     Other libraries include: Servlet, EDI, and development tools. 
      </p>

        <title>Why?</title>
	<p>Every Java application, particularly web based business applications have some
	 common code that is developed over and over again. YAJUL provides a
	 shareable repository for reliable (tested) and well documented reuseable code.

	  <title>Goals</title>
	<ul>
    <li>Provide well documented libraries.  The libraries can be used without resorting to looking at the source code.</li>
    <li>Unit test all the production code.  Programmers can trust the libraries.</li>
    <li>Minimal dependencies.  The user should be able to include a minimal set of libraries.</li>
	</ul>
