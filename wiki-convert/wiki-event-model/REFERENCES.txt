= TODO = 
 * Close all style elements when a block is finished or a sub-document is started.
 * Use styles for verbatim blocks (see mediawiki, jspwiki)
   * Block elements:
     - nowiki - not interpreted text
     - pre (??? - bad name) - only some symbols parcially interpreted
     - inclusion - an external document inclusion
     - references - where a list of references should be included (see MediaWiki) 
     - macro - macro code for block elements (see XWiki/Radeox)
   * Inline elements:
     - math - mathematical formulas
     - image - image inclusion
     - reference - the content of a reference (see MediaWiki); see also 
       "references" in block elements
     - macro - macro code for inline elements (see XWiki/Radeox)
 * Split all references into "uri" and "label" parts. The "label" parts can 
   be declared as String[].
 * Add semantic elements (not only "properties" as for GWiki)

=== Creole Wiki Syntax ==
 * All "=" symbols in headers will be skipped 
 * Headers can contain formatting (** and //). 
   In the spec: the formatting in headers should be ignored (formatting symbols
   are not interpreted) 
 * Lists and table cells can contain multiple lines

=== Google Wiki: Differences ===

 * All "=" symbols in headers will be skipped 

=== JspWiki: Differences ===

 * In definition lists the terms has to have at least one space after the ":" 
   symbol. Otherwise the term will be parsed as an URI.
 * Each table cell and list item can have multiple lines
 * The "~" symbol can be used to escape any other symbols (except spaces and
   new lines)
 * Quotation block is used for all block of lines starting from whitespaces.

 * TODO: Styled blocks can be embedded and they can contain all other elements
   (headers, lists, tables, other styled blocks...)
   
=== XWiki Differences ===
 * All list items can have multiple lines
 * Definition lists are the same as in JSPWiki - like ";term: definition". 
   (They just was not removed from the grammar.)
 * The "\" symbol is used as an escape symbol. (But the "\\" sequence is still 
   a break line. There is a problem here: there is no way to insert the "\" 
   in the text.)

=== Mediawiki Differences ===
 
 * <nowiki> and <pre> elements are not distinguished -- both of them reported as 
   verbatim blocks. 
 * Lines starting with whitespaces are interpretted as preformatted blocks -- 
   their content are parsed and all individual elements are reported to the
   listener.
 * <math> tags are reported as inline verbatim elements.
 * <ref> tag is reported as a special style element
 * <blockquote> support should be added
 * Embedded tables are not implemented
 * Multi-column lists are not implemented (yet)
 * List ordering is not implemented
