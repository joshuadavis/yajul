== Paragraphs ==

Use one or more blank lines to separate paragraphs.

== Typeface ==

||* Name/Sample*   || * Markup *       ||
||  _italic_       || `_italic_`       ||
||  *bold*         || `*bold*`         ||
||  `code`         || {{{`code`}}}     ||
||  {{{code}}}     || `{{{code}}}`     ||
||  ^super^script  || `^super^script`  ||
||  ,,sub,,script  || `,,sub,,script`  ||
|| ~~strikeout~~   || `~~strikeout~~`  ||

You can mix these typefaces in some ways:

||       *Markup*                    ||        *Result*                 ||
|| `_*bold* in italics_`             || _*bold* in italics_             ||
|| `*_italics_ in bold*`             || *_italics_ in bold*             ||
|| `*~~strike~~ works too*`          || *~~strike~~ works too*          ||
|| `~~as well as _this_ way round~~` || ~~as well as _this_ way round~~ ||

== Code ==

If you have a multiline code block that you want to display verbatim,
use the multiline code delimiter:

{{{
{{{
def fib(n):
  if n == 0 or n == 1:
    return n
  else:
    # This recursion is not good for large numbers.
    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
}}}
}}}

Which results in:

{{{
def fib(n):
  if n == 0 or n == 1:
    return n
  else:
    # This recursion is not good for large numbers.
    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
}}}

== Headings ==

{{{
= Heading =
== Subheading ==
=== Level 3 ===
==== Level 4 ====
===== Level 5 =====
====== Level 6 ======
}}}

= Heading =
== Subheading ==
=== Level 3 ===
==== Level 4 ====
===== Level 5 =====
====== Level 6 ======

== Lists ==

Google Code wikis support both bulleted and numbered lists. A list
must be indented at least one space to be recognized as such. You can
also nest lists one within the other by appropriate use of indenting:

{{{
The following is:
  * A list
  * Of bulleted items
    # This is a numbered sublist
    # Which is done by indenting further
  * And back to the main bulleted list

 * This is also a list
 * With a single leading space
 * Notice that it is rendered
  # At the same levels
  # As the above lists.
 * Despite the different indentation levels.
}}}

The following is:
  * A list
  * Of bulleted items
    # This is a numbered sublist
    # Which is done by indenting further
  * And back to the main bulleted list

 * This is also a list
 * With a single leading space
 * Notice that it is rendered
  # At the same levels
  # As the above lists.
 * Despite the different indentation levels.

== Quoting ==

Block quotes place emphasis on a particular extract of text in your
page. Block quotes are created by indenting a paragraph by at least
one space:

{{{
Someone once said:

  This sentence will be quoted in the future as the canonical example
  of a quote that is so important that it should be visually separate
  from the rest of the text in which it appears.
}}}

  of a quote that is so important that it should be visually separate
  from the rest of the text in which it appears.

== Links ==

Links are central to the wiki principle, as they create the web of
content. Google Code wiki permits both internal (within the wiki) and
external links, and in some cases automatically creates a link when it
recognizes either a !WikiWord or an URL.

=== Internal wiki links ===

Internal links within a wiki are created using the syntax below. If
you add a wiki link to a page that does not exist, the link will
appear with a !LittleLink[WikiSyntax ?] to all project members and
owners. Clicking that link will take you to the page creation form
where you can enter content for that page.

If you are not logged in, wiki links that point to non-existent pages
will appear as plain text, without the link to the page creation
form. When you create the target page as a project member or owner,
the link will switch to being an actual hyperlink for all viewers of
the page.

{{{
WikiSyntax is identified and linked automatically

Wikipage is not identified, so if you have a page named [Wikipage] you
need to link it explicitly.

If the WikiSyntax page is actually about reindeers, you can provide a
description, so that people know you're actually linking to a page on
[WikiSyntax reindeer flotillas].

If you want to mention !WikiSyntax without it being autolinked, use an
exclamation mark to prevent linking.
}}}

=== Links to external pages ===

You can of course link to external pages from your own wiki pages,
using a syntax similar to that for internal links:

{{{
Plain URLs such as http://www.google.com/ or ftp://ftp.kernel.org/ are
automatically made into links.

You can also provide some descriptive text. For example, the following
link points to the [http://www.google.com Google home page].

If your link points to an image, it will get inserted as an image tag
into the page:

http://code.google.com/images/code_sm.png

You can also make the image into a link, by setting the image URL as
the description of the URL you want to link:

[http://code.google.com/ http://code.google.com/images/code_sm.png]
}}}

Plain URLs such as http://www.google.com/ or ftp://ftp.kernel.org/ are
automatically made into links.

You can also provide some descriptive text. For example, the following
link points to the [http://www.google.com Google home page].

If your link points to an image (that is, if it ends in `.png`,
`.gif`, `.jpg` or `.jpeg`), it will get inserted as an image into the
page:

http://code.google.com/images/code_sm.png

You can also make the image into a link, by setting the image URL as
the description of the URL you want to link:

[http://code.google.com/ http://code.google.com/images/code_sm.png]

== Tables ==

Tables are created by entering the content of each cell separated by
{{{||}}} delimiters. You can insert other inline wiki syntax in table
cells, including typeface formatting and links.

{{{
|| *Year* || *Temperature (low)* || *Temperature (high)* ||
|| 1900 || -10 || 25 ||
|| 1910 || -15 || 30 ||
|| 1920 || -10 || 32 ||
|| 1930 || _N/A_ || _N/A_ ||
|| 1940 || -2 || 40 ||
}}}
