# Bootstrap for the singleton manager.  The property names are component keys (interface names) and the
# values are implementation classes.  If the component implements Configuration it will be instantiated
# immediately and use to add more components to the container.
#
# Note that if multiple singleton-bootstrap.properties files are in the class path, they will all be processed.  This
# way you can configure your own components into the singleton manager without disturbing Yajul components.
