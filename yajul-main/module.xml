  <detailed>
     YAJUL is a set of Java utility libraries for Java enterprise application development.
     The libraries are organize by the type of useage, allowing a lightweight implementation.
     The core library is required by all other libraries, and includes Log4J logging, IO utilities,
     XML DOM / SAX / XSLT utilities, and some multi-threading code.
     Other libraries include: Servlet, EDI, and development tools. 
  </detailed>

  <what>
    <goal>Provide well documented libraries.  The libraries can be used without resorting to looking at the source code.</goal>
    <goal>Unit test all the production code.  Programmers can trust the libraries.</goal>
    <goal>Minimal dependencies.  The user should be able to include a minimal set of libraries.</goal>
  </what>
    
  <why>
    Every Java application, particularly web based business applications have some common
    code that is developed over and over again.  YAJUL provides a shareable repository for
    reliable (tested) and well documented reuseable code.
