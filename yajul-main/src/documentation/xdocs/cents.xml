      <p>Centipede divides build functionality up into units call "cents".  See the indian penny
         up at the top of the page?  You get it?  Yeah I know.</p>
      <p>A is essentially an identified library (or set of libraries) along with a xbuild.xml.  These
         are located in tools/cents off of the main project directory.</p>
      <p>Cents are distributed as jar files and unzipped in this directory as required.  There are a 
         number of cents available for you already and most of these are documented here; however,
         its very simple to create your own cent.  It requires only a little knowledge of 
         <link href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant">Ant</link> and well some basic rudimentary 
         competence.</p>
      <p>To create a Cent merely create a directory such as myproject.cent.  Create a xbuild.xml
         file such as /tools/cents/centipede.cent/xbuild.xml.  Put in the tasks.properties
         file with the task to fire up. Then run build jar-cent.</p>
