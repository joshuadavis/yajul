    <section title="The project/build.xml File">
        <p>  
             It is suggested that if you're reading this file that perhaps you should start 
             <link href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant">here</link> at the Jakarta Ant homepage
             first.  The Centipede build.xml file is basically an ant build file with some standard
             targets in it as well as calls to Cents and your project targets.
        </p>  
    </section>
    <section title="Walkthrough of build.xml">
        <p>
            Build.xml is the main build entry point, and a pure Ant build file.
            In fact, when you start integrating, it's suggested that you keep your
            usual build file.
        </p>
        <p>
            To use the cent, this file contains an inclusion of basic targets, that
            set up the basic properties from the descriptors and initialize and call
            the cents.
        </p>
        <note>
            The centipede build file puts it at the end, so that line numbers of the 
            build file, when failings occur, remain correct.
        </note>  
        <p>
            To call a cent you just need to call the call-cent target and specify the
            cent-name and the cent-target attributes. You can also supply eventual other
            parameters used by the cent.
        </p>              
        <p>
            That's really all there is to it. 
        </p>    
        <p>
           If you want to add your targets, it's better if you do so in another dir
           (like src/java/targets/[targetname]/xbuild.xml), so that it can later be easily
           reused in a cent.
