              This directory contains the dirs: antipede, cents, and eventually tmp.
        </p>
          <section title="project/tools/antipede">
            <p>
              This directory contains Ant. It is called antipede because it's
              Centipede's Ant. There are no changes in the classes, but because
              of Ant classloading issues, the tasks that are used in cents need
              not to be declared and be present here.
            </p>
             <p>
              This problem is in the plans to be fixed by our Ant friends for release 1.6.
            </p> 
             <p>
              Here there are also some basic tasks that are needed for Centipede, mainly
              the ant-contrib tasks.
              Our commitment is to migrate the tasks used here to Ant ASAP, and has already
              been done with our XmlProperty task.
            </p>

           <section title="project/tools/cents">
            <p>
              Here is where the cents are put and deployed.
              It works exactly as the webapps dir for war files.
            </p>                           
            <p>
              When looking for a cent, if the corresponding mycent.cent dir
              is present it uses that version.
            </p>                           
            <p>                
              If not, it check for a mycent.cent.jar, and unpacks that to a 
              corresponding dir.
            </p>                           
            <p>              
              If none of the two are present, it tries to get them over the
              Net automatically, in the repository specified in the property.xml
              file.
            </p>
            <note>              
              If the mycent.cent.jar is newer than an exixting dir, it is unpacked.

              Temporary work directory for centipede itself.
              Delete at will with no remorse.
