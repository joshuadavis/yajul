                This guide is structured after the Centipede project structure.  Each directory is described with its
                purpose, the notable files it contains and links to its subdirectories.

        <p>
                The project directory (replace project with the name of your project) is generally the CVS module for
                your project.  It contains the <link href="build.xml.html">build.xml</link>, 
                <link href=".">project.xml</link>, <link href=".">module.xml</link>, and 
                <link href=".">layout.xml</link> files.  These files are basically configuration files for
                your project except for build.xml which is of course your project makefile of sorts.
